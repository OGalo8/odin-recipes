    <h3>Homemade Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously
        cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for
        a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad
        and crusty garlic bread.
